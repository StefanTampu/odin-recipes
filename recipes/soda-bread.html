        <p>Irish soda bread is a type of quick bread that relies on baking soda, not yeast, to rise. The bread contains buttermilk, which contains lactic acid. The acid reacts with the baking soda to create air bubbles, resulting in a perfectly risen dough.</p>
        <p>Soda bread became incredibly common during the Irish Potato Famine, as you can make it with only four ingredients: flour, salt, an acid, and baking soda.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flour:</strong> This classic Irish soda bread starts with all-purpose flour.</li>
            <li><strong>Margarine:</strong> Margarine has a higher water content than butter, so the results are often softer. If you want, you can substitute Irish butter.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> Four tablespoons of sugar add the perfect amount of sweetness.</li>
            <li><strong>Leaveners:</strong> Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the bread rise.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the Irish soda bread.</li>
            <li><strong>Buttermilk:</strong> A cup of buttermilk adds flavor and helps the loaf rise even higher.</li>
            <li><strong>Egg:</strong> An egg lends richness and flavor. Plus, it helps bind the dough together.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter:</strong> Brush the unbaked loaf with a mixture of buttermilk and butter before you bake it for extra flavor and shine.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the first six ingredients in a bowl. Stir in the buttermilk and egg.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough out and knead. Form the dough into a round loaf.</li>
            <li>Brush with butter and buttermilk, then cut an X in the top.</li>
            <li>Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        </ol>
